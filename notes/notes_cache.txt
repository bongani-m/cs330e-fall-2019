Example:
>>> a = 250
>>> id(a)
1887346576
>>> a += 1
>>> id(a)
1887346608
>>> a = a + 1
>>> id(a)
1887346640
>>> b = 250
>>> id(b)
1887346576
>>> b += 0
>>> id(b)
1887346576
>>> b = b + 0
>>> id(b)
1887346576
>>>
>>> x = "abc"
>>> id(x)
1166140652880
>>> x += ""
>>> id(x)
1166140652880
>>>

Lines 11-13, define a variable x and stores 2 in it then defines a variable y and stores 2 + 0 in it. 
Then, ensures that x and y are the same object.
Lines 15-17, define two variables x and y and store 257 in both of them. 
Then, ensure that x and y are the same object. 

Note: Python caches integers in the range [-5, 256], so it is expected that integers in that range 
are also identical. i.e., within this range, the variable is its value. outside this range 
the variable is an address.

Lines 19-27, define a variables x and stores 257 in it and a variables y stores 257 + 0 in it. 
Even though x and y have the same value, they are not the same objects due to computation 
i.e., + 0. After subtracting 1 from x and y, they fall in the range and they become the same objects.

Lines 29-37, define a variables x and stores -6 in it and a variables y stores -6 + 0 in it. 
Even though x and y have the same value, they are not the same objects due to computation i.e., + 0. 
After adding 1 to x and y, they fall in the range and they become the same objects.

Lines 39-41, define two variables x and y and store 2.34 in both of them. 
Then, ensure that x and y are the same object, but have the same value.

Lines 43-46, define two variables x and y and store 2.34 and 2.43 + 0 in both of them, 
respectively. Then, ensure that x and y are not the same object.

Lines 48 - 50, define two variables x and y and store "abc" in both of them. 
Then, ensure that x and y are the same object.

Lines 52-54, define two variables x and y and store "abc" and "ab" + "c" in both of them, respectively. 
Then, ensure that x and y are the same object.

Lines 56-61, define 4 variables s, u, and v,  and store "abc",  "ab", "c" in them respectively. 
Then define t = u + v. Then, ensure that s and t are not the same object. 
Since python caches strings only if they are compiled time constants.

Lines 63-66, define two variables a and b and store and empty list (mutable) in both of them. 
Then, ensure that a and b are not the same object. 

Lines 68-70, define two variables a and b and store and empty tuple (immutable) in both of them. 
Then, ensure that a and b are the same object. 

Lines 72-75, define two variables a and b and store and empty set (mutable) in both of them.
Then, ensure that a and b are not the same object. 

Lines 77-79, define two variables a and b and store and empty frozenset (immutable) in both of them. 
Then, ensure that a and b are the same object. 

Lines 81-84, define two variables a and b and store and empty dict (mutable) in both of them. 
Then, ensure that a and b are not the same object.
