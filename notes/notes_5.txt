assertEqual() is one of many kinds of assertions that unittest provides

Python's self is analogous to Java's this

Python's unittest has the nice property that even an internal assertion failure will not stop it 
from running all of the tests

the quality of the unit tests is essential to the usefulness of doing unit tests

the Python tool, coverage, measures how many lines of your code is a unit test actually testing
