class vs function
I am studying for test#1, and I am a little bit confused when to use class and when to use function?

 

Can someone please make it clear? Thank you

Answer:
I will try to explain this using the two examples we have done in class (range and rangeIterator).

 

In RangeIteratorT we see that range_iterator_class and range_iterator_function are imported meaning we can implement the rangeIterator functionality in both a class and a function.

 

In RangeT we see that range_1, and range_2 are imported. More importantly on lines 50-51 list() is called twice and we get a new iterator both times! This logic can't be done in a function, meaning we need to make a class that responds to __iter__().

 

Hope that helps.
