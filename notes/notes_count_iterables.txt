Iterator objects in python conform to the iterator protocol, which basically means they provide 
two methods: __iter__() and __next__(). The __iter__ returns the iterator object and 
is implicitly called at the start of loops. The __next__() method returns the next value 
and is implicitly called at each loop increment. __next__() raises a StopIteration exception 
when there are no more value to return, which is implicitly captured by looping constructs to stop iterating.

As per the definition of an iterable from Python glossary: An object capable of returning its 
members one at a time. Examples of iterables include all sequence types (such as list, str, and tuple) 
and some non-sequence types like dict, file objects, and objects of any classes you define with an __iter__() 
method or with a __getitem__() method that implements Sequence semantics.

 

So no, not all iterables have __getitem__ method but all iterable objects need to implement 
either __iter__() or __getitem__(). The reason why not all iterables implement __getitem__ is 
that you could have a data structure that is iterable but not indexable. __getitem__ method essentially 
takes a key(this could be an integer representing index) and returns the element at that key.
 For a data structure like set there is no key to be given. You can't index a set but you can 
still iterate over it. 

 

As for count, it is just a class method that returns an integer. It can't be an iterator 
since its not even a object if that makes sense. For an object to be an iterator it needs 
to have a __next__ method. 

 

Here is the python glossary with definitions: https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html

Example:
---------
from itertools import count 

x = count(0)  
s = 0
for v in x :
    print(v)
    if v == 10 :
        break
    s += v
# 0, 1, ..., 10
print("After exiting loop x = {}".format(x))

for v in x :
    print(v)
    if v == 20 :
        break
    s += v
# 11, 12, ..., 20
