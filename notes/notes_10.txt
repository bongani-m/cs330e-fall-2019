FunctionTuple.py
Note that iterable packing opens the door for optional parameters.
- *t as an argument (in a function call) means unpacking
- *t as a parameter (in a function definition) in the function signature means packing

FunctionDict.py
- **t as an argument (in a function call) means unpacking
- **t as a parameter (in a function definition) in the function signature means packing

Rules above applies in addition to the following: * (unpacking iterable) must precede ** (unpacking dictionary).
Syntax: 
position should come before name
position should come before unpacking dict
unpacking iterable should come before unpacking dict

Semantic: {By position, unpacking iterable}, by variable name, unpacking dictionary.
