o	Software Engineering:
concept first appeared in a NATO conference in Germany in 1968 to handle software crisis.

The causes of the software crisis were linked to the overall complexity of hardware and the software development process. 
The crisis manifested itself in several ways:
•	Projects running over-budget
•	Projects running over-time
•	Software was very inefficient
•	Software was of low quality
•	Software often did not meet requirements
•	Projects were unmanageable and code difficult to maintain

Software activities vs Software development models
•	Activities are analysis, design, implementation, verification  and validation (testing), maintenance. 
•	Basic development models are: waterfall, incremental, and reuse oriented software development.

According to IEEE’s definition software engineering can be defined as the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to 
the development, operation, and maintenance of software, and the study of these approaches; that is, the application of engineering to software.

•	Comments in Python:
o	#: for one line 
o	''' : for a multiline comment

• if __name__ == "__main__" :
     main()

main() is executed only if the file is run directly, and not imported.

Note: __name__ is an attribute that is automatically set and has the value "__main__" only if the file is executed 
as a script (not if it is imported as a module).

•	Script vs module:
o	Script: directly executable piece of code (run by itself).
o	Module: a library, imported by other piece of code.

•	cProfile: 
an optimization tool that is used to diagnose what makes a program slow.
The output of applying this tool to a python script includes information such as total running time,
 time of each separate function, and how many times each function is executed.

•	-m flag
 allow us to run a modules such as cProfile as a script.

•	range(): returns an object which produces elements on demand. 

•	Three ways to execute a Hello.py
o	type in the shell: "python Hello.py"
o	give executable permission to the file and type in the shell: "Hello.py"
o	run the python interpreter and type in: "import Hello"

•	#! /usr/bin/env python3
o	It's a commented line for Python 
o	Informs that OS that this file should be run by python.
In a Unix-like operating system, the program loader takes the presence of these two characters as an indication that 
the file is a script, and tries to execute that script using the interpreter specified by the rest of the first line in the file.
