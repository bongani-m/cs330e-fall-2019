•	In Python, sets are implemented as a hash table. Items, therefore, has to be hashable. 
•	Sets can only contain hashable elements
•	the immutables (tuple, string, frozenset) are hashable
•	the mutables (list, set, dict) are not hashable.
•	Complexity of looking up an element in a set is constant due to hash (index of an array)
