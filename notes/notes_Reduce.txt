Reduce.py
Notes:
•	reduce() should need at most for their sequences to be iterable, not indexable
•	reverse() needs its sequence to be reverse iterable
•	quicksort() needs its sequence to be indexable - Go to the middle of the list in constant time.
•	a singly-linked list is iterable
•	a doubly-linked list is reverse iterable
•	an array is indexable

•	algorithms should demand the weakest iteration
•	data structures should provide the strongest iteration
